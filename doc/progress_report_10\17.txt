Introduction:

Centered on bioinformatics Scopus research papersâ€™ data, we aim to predict the success of a paper.  The primary indicator of success will
be centered around citations, and we will analyze and determine what factors are most important for the success of a paper.  It is our hope
that various useful, interesting indicators of success will reveal itself through the combination of machine learning and our analysis.

The first phase of the project will consist of data wrangling and organizing, essentially preparing data for machine learning.  The next
phase will be researching and appropriately selecting what machine learning we want to apply.  Finally, we will perform analysis on the
machine learning and present our findings as intuitively and concisely as possible.

Tasks performed by each member:

Darpan Jhawar:
My initial task was to extract certain fields from the JSON files. There were 6 JSON files in total and my task was to extract the fields:
eid
cite	
Lang	
Para	
Title

I created 6 separate .csv files from the 6 JSON files and also created another file merging all of these. I then created a scatter plot
comparing the length of title of a paper to the number of citations.
