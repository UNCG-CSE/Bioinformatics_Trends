Introduction:

Centered on bioinformatics Scopus research papersâ€™ data, we aim to predict the success of a paper.  The primary indicator of success 
will be centered around citations, and we will analyze and determine what factors are most important for the success of a paper.  It is
our hope that various useful, interesting indicators of success will reveal itself through the combination of machine learning and our
analysis.

The first phase of the project will consist of data wrangling and organizing, essentially preparing data for machine learning.  The next
phase will be researching and appropriately selecting what machine learning we want to apply.  Finally, we will perform analysis on the
machine learning and present our findings as intuitively and concisely as possible.

Progress 3 Overview:

In this third leg, we moved past merely representing our data and it's distribution, and begun to dig deeper into what variables might
work best once we start applying machine learning.

Tasks performed by each member:

Luke Davis:

I produced two graphical representations and respective analysis' on the distribution of citations.  I produced two graphs in this
category.
1. a scatterplot
2. a probability distribution of citations over the years of our data.

I also produced graphical representations and analysis on authors and their relationship (or lack thereof) with citations.  I produced 3
graphs/tables in this category:
  1. a probability distribution of mean citations per author
  2. two side-by-side boxplots representing
    a) the papers with authors associated with historically high average citations
    b) all other papers
    c) a table containing the top 5 authors in terms of average citations along with their respective affiliations

Darpan Jhawar:

I worked on the field of Author Keywords and tried to see how it affects the number of citations a paper recieves. To do this I divided
the work into two tasks:
  1. Find top 10 keywords based on their frequency of occurrence
  2. Find top 10 keywords based on average number of citations

I then compared both these results and found that only 1 keyword appeared in both of these lists. To undrestand it better, I generated
probability distribution functions and boxplots for both of these tasks.

Logan Hornbuckle:

I created various graphical representations comparing the average citations/paper for the top 10
fields of study. I seperated them into the following two groups:

1) Top 10 Most Cited Publications
2) Top 10 Most Published Publications

I performed comparisons via boxplot and bargraph visualizations. I also compared the distributions
of the top 2 fields of study from each group (above). Lastly, I tried to visually represent why
Mathematics ranked #1 in "most cited", but was absent from most published. I did this by comparing
its distribution with another field of study in the top 3 from the "most published" group.

Charles S. Stamey

I did alot for this group this time. Hopefully I remain top contributor for the remainder of the semester.

Mouna Kalidindi

I worked on year and publication venue fields. I performed graphical analysis on these fields to see their impact on citation.

Year:
1) Line graph for the number of papers published in each year
2) Line graph for the total number of citations per year
3) Citations to publications ratio
    I found a positive correlation between number of papers published and their citations across years. And based on year and 
citations proportions, it was evident that older the paper higher is the citation rate.

Publication Venues:
1)Top 5 publication venues based on the number of papers published 
2)Top 5 publication venues based on the average number of citations
  Box plots were generated for these tasks to analyze the distribution of data. I also extracted top 5 fields of study based on the   
  publication venues.
