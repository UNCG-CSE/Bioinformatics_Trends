# Bioinformatics_Trends
Centered on bioinformatics Scopus research papersâ€™ data, we aim to predict the success of a paper.  The primary indicator of success will be centered around citations, and we will analyze and determine what factors are most important for the success of a paper.  It is our hope that various useful, interesting indicators of success will reveal itself through the combination of machine learning and our analysis.

The first phase of the project will consist of data wrangling and organizing, essentially preparing data for machine learning.  The next phase will be researching and appropriately selecting what machine learning we want to apply.  Finally, we will perform analysis on the machine learning and present our findings as intuitively and concisely as possible.
